# RIIID! : Python Code

## Name of project: 
Riiid! Answer Correctness Prediction, A Machine Learning Competition from Stanford Graduate School of Education

## Goal:
Predict students' performance on future interaction with time-series API.

## Data:
Processed 130M+ interactions from 780K+ participants.

## Method:
* Exploratory Analysis
* Feature Engineer: 
    - question level: K-mean clustering, hierarchical clustering, social network, Bayesian IRT
    - lecture level: K-mean clustering, hierarchical clustering, social network, Bayesian IRT
    - and student level
*  Predict time-series students' response correctness using lightgbm, XGBoost and logistic regression

## Results:
Achieved 78.3% accuracy in predicting outcome of a question attemp.
